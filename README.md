Installation

- To Install the programm you should have the next software:
    * Any IDE to import the program(Eclipse, Intellij, Netbeans).
    * Installed the IDE with Maven/Grade to import correctly.
    * Download Xamp to run the Apache Server/Tomcat and the Data Base.
    * After that you have to specify in the configuration that the port will be 3000.
    
- To run the Database you can do it with PhpMyAdmin or with other program to manage Databases like MySQL.

- To test the REQUEST to the program I used SoapUI 5.5.0 and you can generate the JSON and send the REQUEST to the server and then storege in the Database.
